I am process: 6 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am process: 1 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am process: 3 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am process: 4 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84

I am process: 5 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am process: 2 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am process: 7 and my processor name is: k-MS-7C84
I can communicate with 8 other processes

I am the First Process!
My processor is k-MS-7C84
My taskID is 0
I can see that there are 8 available processes

Note:
- I can see that MPI starts all of these 8 processes at the same exact time,
- The CPU scheduler then takes over and decides who goes next. This is RANDOM! It's not the same when you run it again.
- Processor name is a little misleading, It's what is returned when you type hostname.
